## EX.

Time to create your first react application and deploy that application

- Create a new application using `create-react-app`
- In the `src` folder create a `components` folder and place the: `Header, Footer, Login, TodoList` components you created in previous ex.
- Connect all your components in the `App.js` component
- Add bootstrap to the `style.css` file
- create a `styles` folder and move the `style.css` and all your styling files to that folder
- If one of your component has an image, than create a folder for that component and add the image to that folder and connect it to the component with an `import` statement.
- Try and deploy your app using [Github Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)
